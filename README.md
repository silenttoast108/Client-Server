The first sample, “client-server” is a client server program that opens a socket and allows the client to execute BASH commands via independent child processes in the server. If the client enters the command “historia” a history of all of the commands executed will be shown. To terminate the program, enter the command “FIN.”

The program “sorting-algorithms” is intended to replicate the use of different sorting algorithms to schedule in memory. It works by accepting numerical values in the file “ejemplo.txt” formatted as <process><instant of arrival><memory required><time required for execution> for each process. The user will then be prompted to enter either 1 or 0 for worst fit and best fit respectively. The program will then write a file that shows the use of memory over time. Additionally, it will graphically display the use of memory over time in the terminal.
